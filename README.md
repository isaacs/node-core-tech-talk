A talk I gave at AirBnB on 2013-01-30.

Slides are in the keynote.  When you hit the `Example` slides, stop
and run the examples.  First one is `binding-example`.  The next one
is non-binding-example.js.

To run the binding example, type `vim *` and then do `:next` to go to
the next bit.  When you hit 10.js or 16.js, stop and run them, and
telnet in and mess around.  10 is a very simple TCP server that does
console.log.  16 is the traditional node TCP chat server.

The non-binding-example is just the same thing as 16.js, but using the
`'net'` module, like a real person.
